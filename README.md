# Smart-White-Cane
 I worked on a cool project with a client to make a special cane for blind peopleI worked on a cool project with a client to make a special cane for blind people. This cane helps them walk safely by sensing stuff in front of them. I used Tensorflow lite, YOLO, and openCV.
Here's how it works: When a person walks with the cane, it can tell if there's something like a car or a person in front of them. It even says how far away the thing is, like "car, 234 centimeters" or "person, 34 centimeters." This info is spoken through earphones so the user knows what's ahead and how close it is.

There's also a special button on the cane. If the user has trouble or feels unsafe, they can press it. Then, a message is sent to their guardian with their location. This helps the guardian come and help them quickly.

I used stuff like a Raspberry Pi 4, a camera, and sensors to make this cane smart. I also wrote code in Python to make everything work smoothly. And I used Twilio software to send emergency messages.

I'm proud of this project because it helps blind people feel more confident and safe when they're out and about. It was a great experience working on it
